# 🔐 Security Fundamentals  
*Building safer web applications with real-world examples*

---

## 🧠 Overview

Security is one of the most important parts of any web application.  
A single weak spot can expose user data, leak credentials, or break trust.  

In this article, we’ll learn how modern web apps stay secure using:
- JWT vs Session-based Authentication  
- OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  
- Password hashing with bcrypt  
- CORS configuration  
- Common security vulnerabilities  

We’ll explore each topic with **simple logic, real-world use cases**, and **clear examples**.

---

## 🪙 1. JWT vs Session-Based Authentication

Both **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **Session-based authentication** handle how users stay logged in — but they work differently.

---

### 🔸 Session-Based Authentication

**How it works:**
1. User logs in with a username and password.  
2. Server creates a **session** (stores user info in memory or database).  
3. A **session ID** is sent to the browser as a cookie.  
4. Every next request includes that cookie to prove identity.

**Example Flow:**

```

User → Login → Server stores session → Cookie sent to browser → Future requests use cookie

```

**Pros:**
- Secure if cookies are set with `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.  
- Easy to implement.  

**Cons:**
- Server must store sessions → more load.  
- Doesn’t scale easily for distributed apps.

---

### 🔹 JWT (JSON Web Token)

**How it works:**
1. User logs in → server sends a **signed token (JWT)** to the client.  
2. Client stores it (usually in localStorage).  
3. Each future request sends the token in headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).  
4. The server verifies the token without needing to store it.

**Example Flow:**

```

User → Login → Server creates JWT → Browser stores it → JWT sent with every request

```

**Pros:**
- No need to store sessions.  
- Great for APIs and microservices.  

**Cons:**
- If stolen, JWT is valid until it expires.  
- Must handle logout and refresh securely.

---

💡 **Real-World Example:**
- **Session-based auth:** Common in websites like WordPress, which use cookies to manage logins.  
- **JWT:** Used in modern SPAs (React, Vue, Angular) and mobile apps — like Instagram or Twitter APIs.

## 🌐 2. OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

These are **protocols for secure login and authorization**, used when users log in with **Google, GitHub, or Facebook**.

---

### 🔸 OAuth2 (Authorization)

**Definition:**  
OAuth2 allows third-party apps to access limited user data without sharing passwords.

**Example Flow (GitHub Login):**

1. You click “Login with GitHub.”  
2. GitHub asks: “Do you allow this app to access your profile?”  
3. If yes → GitHub sends a **token** to your app.  
4. Your app uses this token to fetch only permitted info.

**Real Example:**
> When you use LinkedIn to connect your GitHub, OAuth2 ensures GitHub shares only what’s allowed — not your password.

---

### 🔹 OpenID Connect (Authentication Layer on Top of OAuth2)

**Definition:**  
OAuth2 handles *authorization* (access to resources).  
**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** adds *authentication* — verifying *who the user is*.

**Example Flow (Google Login):**
1. User clicks “Login with Google.”  
2. Google verifies the user and sends an **ID token (JWT)** to your app.  
3. The app reads user info (name, email) from the token — no password needed.

**Real Example:**
> When you log into Spotify with your Google account, OpenID Connect handles the identity verification behind the scenes.

---

## 🔐 3. Password Hashing with bcrypt

Storing plain passwords is one of the biggest security mistakes.  
If your database leaks, attackers can see every password.

---

### 🔸 bcrypt

**Definition:**  
bcrypt is a **password hashing function** that securely stores passwords by turning them into unreadable strings.

**How it works:**
1. User creates a password: `MySecret123`  
2. bcrypt adds a random **salt** (extra random characters).  
3. It hashes both the password + salt into something like:  
```

$2b$12$kH7hd9...9yx0p

````
4. The server stores only this hash — not the original password.

**Example (Python):**

```python
from passlib.hash import bcrypt

hashed = bcrypt.hash("MySecret123")
print(hashed)

# Verify later
bcrypt.verify("MySecret123", hashed)
````

💡 **Real-World Example:**
Every time you sign up for Gmail or Instagram, your password is hashed with algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
Even Google can’t see your real password — only the hash.

---

## 🌍 4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**Definition:**
CORS controls which websites can access your API.

Without it, **any site** could make requests to your backend — causing major security issues.

---

### 🔸 Example

Let’s say your frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

and your API is hosted on:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

By default, browsers **block** requests between different origins.

To fix this safely, you must enable **CORS** only for trusted origins.

**FastAPI Example:**

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

origins = ["http://localhost:3000"]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

💡 **Real-World Example:**
Imagine your API accepts payment data — without CORS, any random site could try to send fake requests to it.
CORS ensures only your trusted frontend can access your backend.

## ⚠️ 5. Common Security Vulnerabilities

Every developer should know and protect against the most common web vulnerabilities.

---

### 🧨 SQL Injection

**Problem:** Attackers inject malicious SQL into input fields.
**Example:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
```

**Fix:** Always use **parameterized queries** or ORM frameworks.

💡 **Real Example:**
In 2013, Yahoo was hacked through SQL injection that exposed millions of user accounts.

---

### 🧨 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Problem:** Attackers inject scripts into pages viewed by other users.
**Example:**

```html
<input value="<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>">
```

**Fix:** Sanitize all user inputs before rendering on the page.

💡 **Real Example:**
Social media comment sections are common XSS targets —
hackers try to inject malicious scripts disguised as comments.

---

### 🧨 CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Problem:** A malicious site tricks users into performing actions while logged in elsewhere.
**Fix:** Use **CSRF tokens** in every form submission and verify them on the backend.

💡 **Real Example:**
Banking apps add CSRF tokens to prevent attackers from transferring money using logged-in sessions.

---

### 🧨 Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Problem:** User can access data by changing an ID in the URL.
**Example:**
`/api/users/2` instead of `/api/users/1`

**Fix:** Always verify that the logged-in user owns or is allowed to view the resource.

💡 **Real Example:**
In 2021, several fintech apps were reported leaking user info due to missing ID access checks.

## 💡 Real-World Takeaway

Security is not a one-time setup — it’s a continuous process.
In real software teams (like at Google or PayPal), engineers perform **code reviews, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing** regularly.

A secure app doesn’t just protect data — it protects **user trust**.
