# 🧠 Find Duplicates in Array

This is one of the most popular **array problems** from the Blind 75 list.  
It checks how well you can handle **repeated values** and understand **time-space trade-offs**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, return all numbers that appear **more than once**.

### Example
```

Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]

```

---

## 💡 Approach 1 — Using a Set (Simple and Clear)

We can use a **set** to track which numbers have been seen before.

### Steps
1. Create an empty set `seen`
2. Create an empty list `duplicates`
3. Loop through each number in `nums`
4. If it’s already in `seen`, add it to `duplicates`
5. Otherwise, add it to `seen`

### Pseudocode
```

create empty set seen
create empty list duplicates

for num in nums:
if num in seen:
add num to duplicates
else:
add num to seen

return duplicates

```

### Python Code
```

def find_duplicates(nums):
seen = set()
duplicates = []

```
for num in nums:
    if num in seen:
        duplicates.append(num)
    else:
        seen.add(num)

return duplicates
```

print(find_duplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))  # Output: [2, 3]

```

---

## ⚙️ Approach 2 — In-Place Method (O(1) Space)

If modifying the array is allowed,  
we can **mark visited numbers** by flipping their index value negative.

### Steps
1. Loop through each number  
2. Use its absolute value to find the index  
3. If that index value is already negative → it’s a duplicate  
4. Otherwise, flip it to negative to mark as visited

### Python Code
```

def find_duplicates(nums):
duplicates = []

```
for num in nums:
    index = abs(num) - 1
    if nums[index] < 0:
        duplicates.append(abs(num))
    else:
        nums[index] = -nums[index]

return duplicates
```

print(find_duplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))  # Output: [2, 3]

```

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example

Imagine a **task tracking app** where users upload a list of task IDs.  
You need to check if any task ID appears more than once.

```

task_ids = [101, 204, 305, 204, 509, 101]
duplicates = find_duplicates(task_ids)
print("Duplicate Task IDs:", duplicates)

# Output: Duplicate Task IDs: [204, 101]

```

This avoids duplicate entries and keeps your data clean.

## 🧭 Key Takeaways

- ✅ Use **Set-based approach** for readability  
- ✅ Use **In-place approach** for memory efficiency  
- 🧠 Common real-world use cases:  
  - Duplicate user sign-ups  
  - Duplicate product listings  
  - Repeated transaction IDs
