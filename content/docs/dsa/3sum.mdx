# 🧩 3Sum Problem — Finding Zero-Sum Triplets

## 🧠 What is the 3Sum Problem?

The **3Sum problem** is one of the most popular array problems in coding interviews.  
The goal is simple:  

> Find all unique triplets in an array that add up to **zero (0)**.

You must make sure that the same triplet (like `[-1, 0, 1]`) is **not repeated**.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return **all unique triplets `[a, b, c]`** such that:

```

a + b + c == 0

````

and all values are taken from different indices in the array.

---

## 🏙 Real-World Example

Imagine you’re building a **financial analysis tool**.

You have a list of **daily profit/loss values**:
- Negative numbers → losses  
- Positive numbers → profits  

Now, you want to find **three days** whose total **net effect is 0** — meaning the total profit and loss balance each other out.

Example:  
If the array is `[-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`,  
then the days with `[-1, 0, 1]` or `[-1, -1, 2]` make the total profit/loss **zero**.

---

## 🧩 Example

### Input:
```python
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
````

### Output:

```python
[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

Explanation:

* `(-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0`
* `(-1) + 0 + 1 = 0`

## ⚙️ Approach — Sorting + Two Pointers

We can solve this problem **efficiently** using the **two-pointer technique** after sorting.

### Steps:

1. **Sort** the array.
2. Loop through each element `i` as the **first number**.
3. Use two pointers:

   * `left` starts right after `i`
   * `right` starts at the end of the array
4. Check the sum of `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`

   * If sum == 0 → save triplet
   * If sum < 0 → move `left` right
   * If sum > 0 → move `right` left
5. Skip duplicates to avoid repeated triplets.

## 🧾 Python Code

```python
from typing import List

def three_sum(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    nums.sort()
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        # Skip duplicate first numbers
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue

        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

            if total == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

                # Skip duplicates
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1

                left += 1
                right -= 1

            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return result
```

## 🧮 Example Run

```python
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
print(three_sum(nums))
```

**Output:**

```
[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Step                              | Complexity                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Sorting                           | O(n log n)                      |
| Two-pointer scan for each element | O(n²)                           |
| **Total Time**                    | **O(n²)**                       |
| **Space**                         | **O(1)** (ignoring output list) |

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ Use **sorting + two pointers** for efficiency
✅ Skip **duplicate numbers** to avoid repeating triplets
✅ Time complexity is **O(n²)** which is optimal for this problem

## 🌍 Real-World Analogy

Think of having three friends splitting a dinner bill.

Each friend contributes money — some might overpay, some might underpay.
You want to find **three people** whose total payments **perfectly balance** the cost.

That’s exactly what the 3Sum problem does — find groups that **sum to zero** (balanced).
